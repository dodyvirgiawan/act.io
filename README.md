# act.io
Act.io, a simple to-do list app. Built with **express** framework, with **PostgreSQL** as DBMS and **Sequelize** as ORM.

- **MVP**: User is able to set a reminder for their to do list in the desired date and time. Act.io will then send the reminder via SMS to user's registered phone number.

- Third party API used is **Vonage API**, combined with **node-schedule** package from npm.
- Templating engine used is EJS, combined with bootstrap framework.

Notes: The reminder feature might not work properly as I don't have any credits left from Vonage API. :(
