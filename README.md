# act.io
Act.io, a simple to-do list app. Built with express framework, with PostgreSQL as DBMS and Sequelize as ORM.

MVP: User is able to set a reminder for their to do list in the desired date and time. Act.io will then send the reminder via SMS to user's registered phone number.

Third part API used is Vonage API, combined with node-schedule package.

Notes: The reminder feature might not work properly as I don't have any credits left from vonage API. :(
